#### Adding DCBlurMenu to your project

The easiest way to do this is using CocoaPods. Simply add ```'DCBlurMenu'``` into your Podfile.


To install manually youâ€™ll have to:

    - Clone the git repository and initialize submodules
    - Drag the DCBlurMenu into your project
    
DCBlurMenu supports ARC.

#### Getting Started

As of now DCBlurMenu relies on the use of Storyboards. The setup should include one UINavigationController and the views you will show when a menu item is selected (make sure to give them an ID to reference them by). Subclass ```DCBlurMenuNavigationController``` and implement the following methods:

```objective-c
// mandatory
- (void)createMenu;
- (void)selectedItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index // is triggered upon menu selection
// optional
-(void)menuIsAnimating;
```

*Make sure to also set your statusbar to light content!*

#### Example

```objective-c
- (void)createMenu
{
    // Create Menu Items
    DCMenuItem *first = [DCMenuItem new];
    first.title = @"First";
    first.storyboardID = @"firstView";
    
    DCMenuItem *second = [DCMenuItem new];
    second.title = @"Second";
    second.storyboardID = @"secondView";
    
    DCMenuItem *third = [DCMenuItem new];
    third.title = @"Third";
    third.storyboardID = @"thirdView";
    
    DCMenuItem *fourth = [DCMenuItem new];
    fourth.title = @"Fourth";
    fourth.storyboardID = @"fourthView";
    
    self.menuItems = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:first, second, third, fourth, nil];
    
    // Set starting index
    self.startIndex = 0;
    self.cellSelectedColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:137/255.f green:224/255.f blue:250/255.f alpha:.4];
    self.animationDuration = 0.4f;
    self.cellHeight = 70.f;
}

- (void)selectedItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
{
    NSLog(@"IndexPath Selected: %li", index);
}
```

Set your UINavigationController class to it and you're set! Make sure to check out the demo project for reference.

#### Appearance Attributes
The following styling properties are available for modification
```objective-c
@property (nonatomic) UIColor *cellSelectedColor;
@property (nonatomic) float animationDuration;
@property (nonatomic) float cellHeight; // default to 70 which only fits 4 items
```
